# Stories and personas
Aldo is going to the sea in a beautiful summer day with his family: Ramona his wife, Giacomino and Andr√® his sons. During the trip the gas of his machine is going to finish and he checks on EZGas app the nearest and the cheapest gas station to full his machine. Without this app he should probably go to an other gas station and he probably pay more money than the gas station find on the app. In unlucky way he could finish the gas in his machine and he must find a gas station on foot.

Jonh buy a gas station and he registers his self on EZGas to put his gas station on the app and set the price of gas to rase money and to get noticed by peolpe that want buy gas for theirs machine. Every day he uodates ,if necessary, the price of gas of his gas station.
